## UX

### Project Goals

The primary goal of Marvel - Match is to provide a clean, intuitive and child friendly game to entertain and delight it's users.

#### Player Goal

The central target audience for this game is pre-school children aged 5 to 10 years old.

Players goals are:

1. A fun game to play.
2. Child friendly controls.
3. Large buttons and clickable areas for young fingers to operate.
4. Fun images and sounds.
5. Option to have backgorund audio while playing.
6. Easy to understand how it works.

Marvel - Match met these goals by:

1. The planning and design process took all these needs into account before starting to build it.
2. Game controls are large, utilising icons and colours to communicate their purpose before any words that a child would not be able to read.
3. Marvel - Match includes audio and different sound as part of the game.
4. The overall feel of this game is fun and child-friendly.

#### Developer and Business Goals

1. Well thought out programming that prepares for a child's random and unpredictable use of Marvel - Match. For example, that the game cannot be broken by clicking many cards quickly.
2. Get a stronger grasp on writing code with a more professional focus.
3. Gain a more intrinsic understanding of JavaScript and jQuery 
4. A project the developer is excited to make a part of her portfolio.

#### User Stories

As a player aged between 5-10 years old, I want:

1. The ability to easily find and understand the controls for the game, so that I can operate them easily.
2. A large easy to press buttons and controls, so that my young fingers can use on all devices.
3. Audio and/or visual feedback when I play the game, so that I know when I have clicked or not clicked something.
4. Positive audio feedback when I complete a step in the game (for example when I find a matching pair of cards), because this increases my enjoyment from playing.

### Design Choices

The overall feel of the game is one that is designed for children to enjoy. The following design choices were made with this in mind:

#### Fonts

The primary font **Press Start 2P, cursive** was chosen because it resembles the simple letters used in videogames.

#### Colours

The primary colour choices of dark and light blue for the logo, titles and text were chosen because they have a clean clear aspect while contrasting each other well.
Other colours used in the project were taken from the trophy image sourced, using a colour picker in Photoshop to make sure all colours used were consistent across the entire project.

#### Styling

Cards and container boxes were given rounded corners to continue the child friendly theme, many real life memory cards for children have corners like this.
Repeating the same rounded corner pattern throughout the page keeps consistency in design and maintains the feeling that all elements belong together.

#### Card images

The Avangers characters were chosen for this game because they are recognised and loved by all new generations.

#### Audio files

To continue the feeling of a game made for children and Avengers fans, the background sound is the Avanger Theme.
The card flipping sounds and "bing" on a correct match were added to give positive feedback on use of the game.
The sound of Victory played on completing the game was chosen because it appeals most to children.
